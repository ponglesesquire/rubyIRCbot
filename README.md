rubyIRCbot is an aptly named IRC bot created using the Ruby language.

In it's current status it does not do much at all, however there are some features I wish to add at some point:
* plugin based command system which allows for the use of multiple languages to create the commands (python, lua, ruby, etc.)
* ability to create simple commands through the IRC interface which can be reused and compounded
* act as a mailbot, allowing both the sending and receiving of both public and private mail
* and more that I cannot think of at the moment.

My ruby skills are a bit shakey, however that is part of the reason I am doing this project.

Happy trails!
